**How It Works**

Game Setup:

A grid of dots is created dynamically using JavaScript.
Each dot is assigned a random color, with each color appearing exactly twice.

Gameplay:

Click on dots to reveal their colors.
Match two dots of the same color to score points and unlock motivational content.
If the colors do not match, the dots are hidden again.

Dynamic Modal:

Upon a successful match, a modal displays a random image and an inspiring message.
Modal content is dynamically updated based on the number of matches.

Restart and Timer:

The game timer starts when the game begins and resets upon restarting.
Restarting the game clears the grid, score, and timer.

**Technologies Used**

HTML5: For the game layout and structure.
CSS3: For styling the game board, dots, and modal.
JavaScript (ES6): For dynamic DOM manipulation, gameplay logic, and modal interactions.

Play and enjoy the game!
