Match two dots of the same color to score points and unlock motivational content.
If the colors do not match, the dots are hidden again.

Dynamic Modal:

Upon a successful match, a modal displays a random image and an inspiring message.
Modal content is dynamically updated based on the number of matches.

Restart and Timer:

The game timer starts when the game begins and resets upon restarting.
Restarting the game clears the grid, score, and timer.
